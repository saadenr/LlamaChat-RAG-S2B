In this mini project, we are exploring advanced techniques within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our objective is to enhance the RAG workflow by addressing issues that exist in conventional RAG methods.

Initially, the focus has been on "small-to-big retrieval," a technique that involves using smaller, more targeted text chunks during this retrieval process to improve accuracy, while also providing sufficient context for synthesis by a large language model.

Two primary approaches are utilized in small-to-big retrieval:

1. Retrieving smaller child chunks referring to larger parent chunks.
2. Using sentence window retrieval to improve contextual information.
