This process can be directly measured by changes in soil organic carbon stocks and indirectly by measuring the net balance of carbon fluxes. Grasslands have been shown to sequester an average of 5,630 g C/m2 per year through soil organic carbon stocks and 2231 and 77 g C/m2 per year for drained organic and mineral soils, respectively, through carbon flux balance.\n\nTo enhance carbon sequestration in grasslands, various management practices can be implemented, including:\n1. Avoiding soil tillage and the conversion of grasslands to arable use.\n2. Moderately intensifying nutrient-poor permanent grasslands.\n3. Using light grazing instead of heavy grazing.\n4. Increasing the duration of grass leys.\n5. Converting grass leys to grass-legume mixtures or permanent grasslands.\n\nThese practices can help reduce carbon losses and increase carbon sequestration in grasslands, ultimately contributing to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in ruminant production systems.",
        "8cf018cb-e30d-4fd7-9bb7-ff558600a48e": "The implications of soil carbon sequestration being reversible and vulnerable to disturbance are that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration in grasslands need to be carefully managed to avoid land use changes that reduce ecosystem soil carbon stocks and to preserve and restore soils and their organic matter content. To reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the livestock sector while preserving current soil organic carbon stocks, measures such as reducing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, fossil-fuel energy, and nitrogen-rich feedstuffs by farms can be implemented. Combined with other mitigation measures, these actions may lead to substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions per unit land area and per unit animal product.",
        "69ffea7e-99c7-472b-b788-369ee5c183b3": "Some examples of grassland types and their corresponding management practices mentioned in Table 1 of the document include grazed peat-pasture in California, USA managed using Eddy covariance method, mixed grass in Mandan ND, USA with no fertilizer, no burning, and last grazed 4 years ago, permanent grassland in England and Wales with soil carbon concentration change over 25 years, rotational grass in England and Wales with soil carbon concentration change over 25 years, grassland in Belgium with soil carbon concentration change over 50 years, grassland in China with soil carbon concentration change over 18 years, perennial grassland converted from arable land in Central Texas, USA with soil carbon stock change over 6 to 60 years, cultivated site to restored grassland in Missouri coteaux, Canada with soil carbon stock change over 8 years, heavy to light grazing grassland in Cheyenne, WY, USA with soil carbon stock change over 21 years, exclosure to light grazing grassland in Cheyenne, WY, USA with soil carbon stock change over 21 years, nutrients addition via fertilizer in various locations, conversion of cultivated land to grassland in various locations, improved grazing management in various locations, improved grass species in various locations, restoration of degraded lands in US great plains, sown grassland on mineral soil in France, and reduction of N fertilizer input in France.",

For example, in the case of nutrients addition via fertilizer, the duration of 30 years resulted in a soil carbon stock change of 30 units, as indicated by Conant et al. (2001). Similarly, the conversion of cultivated land to grassland over a duration of 30 years resulted in a soil carbon stock change of 101 units, as also reported by Conant et al. (2001). These examples suggest that longer durations of management practices can lead to significant changes in soil carbon stock.",

On average, degradation reduced SOC stocks to 95% and 97% of carbon stored under nominal conditions in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. In contrast, improving grasslands with a single management activity enhanced SOC stocks by 14% and 17% in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. With additional improvements, SOC stocks increased by another 11%.",

On the other hand, direct measurements of stock change require several years or decades to detect significant effects due to high variability among samples.\n\nSome key carbon fluxes that need to be measured in the approach of estimating carbon sequestration through carbon flux measurements include:\n1. Trace gases exchanged with the atmosphere (e.g. CO2, CH4, volatile organic compounds)\n2. Organic carbon imports (e.g. manures) and exports (e.g. harvests, animal products)\n3. Dissolved carbon lost in waters (dissolved organic and inorganic carbon)\n4. Lateral transport of soil carbon through erosion.",

This is because droughts can lead to more frequent and intense droughts, which would result in carbon loss from soils. Additionally, high temperature changes and reduced summer rainfall are likely to offset the positive effects of increased grassland productivity due to rising atmospheric CO2 levels. Overall, future drought events could have a negative impact on carbon sequestration in temperate grasslands.",

Increased frequency of drought events could turn temperate grasslands into carbon sources, contributing to positive carbon-climate feedbacks.\n2. Heat-wave conditions are likely to increase in frequency, leading to more frequent and intense droughts, potentially resulting in carbon loss from soils.\n3. Rising atmospheric CO2 levels may reduce the sensitivity of grassland ecosystems to drought and increase grassland productivity, but these positive effects may not offset the negative impacts of high temperature changes and reduced summer rainfall.\n4. Changes in temperature and precipitation are likely to lead to shifts in plant species distribution, potentially negatively impacting biodiversity at regional and global scales.\n5. Rapid loss of plant diversity projected under climate change could also pose a threat to carbon sequestration by grassland soils.",

Grazed sites had a positive GHG balance, indicating a sink activity, while cut and mixed sites had a negative GHG balance, indicating a source activity. Based on the results, a grazing management strategy seems to be more effective in removing GHG from the atmosphere compared to a cutting management strategy.",
        "f7fcb8e1-9644-4327-8dcf-c37309060da6": "The main challenges identified in including carbon sequestration in greenhouse gas budgets at the farm scale, as discussed in the document, are the lack of consistent grassland management data across Europe and the lack of detailed grassland soil carbon inventories for soil model initialization. \n\nCurrent models for estimating farm GHG balance fall short in capturing the environmental dependency of GHG fluxes because they use fixed emission factors for both indoors and outdoors emissions, do not include possible changes in soil carbon resulting from farm management, and rely on static factors rather than dynamic simulations, which means they do not capture the environmental dependency of GHG fluxes.",

This fraction varies between 0.25 and 0.45 and is already accounted for by the f humif coefficient in the estimation of NCS. However, the assumptions made in the calculation of NCS, such as all harvested C being ingested by ruminants and the non-digestible fraction returned as excreta being used for spreading, could lead to an overestimation of the attributed NCS. Additional C losses take place after forage harvests and in manure storage systems, but these losses concern the degradable fraction of manures and are accounted for by the f humif coefficient.",

(2007), include CO2 emissions (F CO2@barn), carbon exports in animal products from ruminants (F animal-products@barn), CO2 losses from microbial degradation of farm effluents during storage and after spreading (F labile-C-losses), methane emissions at barn from enteric fermentation (F CH4@barn), and methane emissions from farm effluents (F CH4-manure).",
        "2ea9e539-800e-4e07-aa65-d9cda2c48c4d": "The application of organic manure in livestock production systems can impact carbon sequestration at the farm scale. Carbon transfer between different fields is common, and the application of organic manure can vary from year to year. When organic manure is applied to fields, the non-digestible carbon in the manure can be excreted by ruminants and incorporated into manure that is spread on the same or another field. This off-site carbon sequestration can occur when more carbon manure is produced than that returned to a grassland plot. Overall, the application of organic manure can play a significant role in the farm greenhouse gas budget and carbon sequestration efforts.",

This calculation takes into account methane emissions from manure management. By adding the off-site carbon sequestration to the on-site carbon sequestration, an attributed NCS (Att-NCS) is calculated using a specific formula that includes factors such as the fraction of non-labile carbon in manure, the proportion of ingested carbon that is digestible, and methane emissions from farm effluents."
